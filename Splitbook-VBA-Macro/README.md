# Splitbook VBA Macro

A VBA macro for Microsoft Excel that exports each worksheet in a workbook as a separate PDF file.

## Overview
The `Splitbook` macro automates the conversion of each worksheet in an Excel workbook into an individual PDF file. PDFs are formatted in landscape orientation, fitted to one page wide, and saved in the workbook's directory with the worksheet's name as the filename. This is ideal for generating reports, archiving worksheets, or sharing individual sheets as PDFs.

## Features
1. Exports each worksheet as a separate PDF.
2. Sets landscape orientation and fits columns to one page wide.
3. Saves PDFs in the workbook's directory, named after each worksheet.
4. Fast execution with suppressed screen updates and alerts.

## Prerequisites
